# RIML Javascript Parser

## Summary

RIML is a YAML-based grammer for describing application routing information.
It's used for generating documentation, running tests, and generating routing
configuration files for applications.

It's similar to RAML in some ways, but vastly different in others.

## Specification

The official specification can be found [here](https://github.com/supernovus/riml-spec).

## Other implementations

There is a PHP implementation as a part of my [Nano.php](https://github.com/supernovus/nano.php) library set.
